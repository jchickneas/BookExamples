# Arrays and Strings

## **Is Unique**: 

### Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters.

## **Check Permutation**:

### Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.

## **URLify**:

### Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'.  You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string.  (Note: if implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.)

```
EXAMPLE

Input: "Mr John Smith     ", 13

Output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"
```

## **Palindrome Permutation**:

### Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome.  A paliondrome is a word or phrase that is thew same forwards and backwards.  A permutation is a rearrangement of letters.  The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.  You can ignore casing and non-letter characters.

```
EXAMPLE 

Input: Tact Coa

Output: True (permutations: "taco cat", "atco cta", etc.)
```
