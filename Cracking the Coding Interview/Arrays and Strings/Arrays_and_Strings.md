# Arrays and Strings

Problems which are not yet completed

## **One Away**:

### There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character, remove a character or replace a character.  Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit or zero edits away.

```
Example
pale, ple -> true

pales, pale -> true

pale, bale -> true

pale, bake -> false
```

## **String Compression**:

### Implement a method to perform basic strring compression using the counts of repeated characters.  For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2b1c5a3.  If your "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, then your method should return the original string.  You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a-z)

## **Rotate Matrix**:

### Given an image represented by an N x N matgrix, where each pixel in the image is represented by an integer, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?

## **Zero Matrix**:

### Write an algorithm such that if an element in an M x N matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0.

## **String Rotation**:

### Assume you have a method *isSubString* which checks if one word is a substring of another.  Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to *isSubstring* (e.g., "waterbottle is a rotation of "erbottlewat").
